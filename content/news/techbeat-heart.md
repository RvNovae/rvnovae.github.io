The small indie studio [Lost Machine Games](https://www.lostmachinegames.com/) reached out to me
about having my music featured in their Shoot-Em-Up TechBeatHeart.
I enjoyed working with them and would like to thank them for the opportunity.

I still have a limited number of Steam-Keys that I received from the developers.
If the game looks interesting to you, feel free to send me an email (or a DM on social media)
and I'll send you one of the leftover keys!
